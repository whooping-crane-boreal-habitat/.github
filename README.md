# Whooping Crane Habitat Seleciton in Boreal Canada 

### The whooping crane (*Grus americana*) is one of the most well-recognized endangered species in North America. The Aransas-Wood Buffalo population (AWBP) is the last remaining wild, self-sustaining crane population, containing approximately 500 individuals. This population winters at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge on the gulf coast of Texas, USA, and spends summers in Wood Buffalo National Park in northern Alberta, Canada, and adjacent areas in Northwest Territories. The location of the nesting grounds in Wood Buffalo National Park means the AWBP migrates twice yearly through the Oils Sands Region (OSR) in north-central Alberta.
