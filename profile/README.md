# Whooping Crane Habitat Seleciton in Boreal Canada 

The whooping crane (*Grus americana*) is one of the most well-recognized endangered species in North America. The Aransas-Wood Buffalo population (AWBP) is the last remaining wild, self-sustaining crane population. This population winters at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge on the gulf coast of Texas, USA, and spends summers in Wood Buffalo National Park in northern Alberta, Canada, and adjacent areas in Northwest Territories. The location of the nesting grounds in Wood Buffalo National Park means the AWBP migrates twice yearly through the Oils Sands Region (OSR) in north-central Alberta. 

The AWBP hit a low of ~16 individuals in 1941, from whch it has been able to rebound to over 500 individuals through the diligent efforts of two natiaonal governmnets (Canada and the United States), and an innumerable number of dedicated people. The purpose of this reseach is the quantify habitat use by cranes both during migration and breeding. The results will be utilized to better map critical habitat areas for cranes in the boreal, better understand risks to the population, and develop mitigation strategies to reduce those risks.
